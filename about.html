        <h2>Why I pursued web design</h2>
        <p>When I found myself with more time throughout the pandemic, I wanted to learn new skills. I was initially interested in front-end engineering, and learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJS, etc. Eventually, I began to research more into the design side of the process, and enrolled in the Google UX Design Professional Certificate. After learning the UX design process and visual design principles, I began building proficiency with tools like Figma. The way this field combines artistic and analytical work makes it an exciting line of work to pursue, and I'm eager to keep learning!</p>
        <h2>Me, aside from design</h2>
        <p>Playing electric and acoustic guitar and learning a foreign language are two main hobbies of mine!</p>
