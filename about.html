        <h2>Why I pursued design</h2>
        <p>The pandemic gave me time to learn new skills. I was initially interested in front-end web development, and learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJS, etc. As I built mock webpages and websites to practice using these tools, I eventually realized that it was the creative aspect of web design that I found particularly rewarding, rather than the code writing itself. I began to research more into the design side of the development process, and discovered the fields of UX/UI. I enrolled in the Google UX Design Professional Certificate, and learned the design process, wireframing, prototyping, user research, visual design principles, and how to use tools such as Figma and Adobe XD. The way UX/UI combines artistic and analytical thinking makes it an especially exciting line of work to pursue, and I'm eager to keep learning!</p>
        <h2>What I hope to achieve</h2>
        <p>I aspire to contibute to a world where products are accessible, useful, and used with ease. By thoroughly understanding user needs and pain points, I want to create designs that leave users remembering an exceptional experience.</p>
        <h2>Me, aside from design</h2>
        <p>In my free time, you'll often find me creating or learning something. Some of my non-design related hobbies include cooking/baking, finding something new to play on my guitar, teaching myself a technical skill, and drinking coffee.</p>
