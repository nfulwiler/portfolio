        <p>In addition to strengthening the visual appeal of a UI, good design increases usability. This is not only crucial from a business perspective, it's also just beneficial to everyone.</p>

        <h2>Why I pursued design</h2>
        <p>When I found myself with more time throughout the pandemic, I wanted to learn new skills. I was initially interested in front-end engineering, and learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJS, etc. As I built mock webpages and websites to practice using these tools, I eventually realized that it was the creative aspect of web design that I found particularly rewarding, rather than the code writing itself. I began to research more into the design side of the process, and discovered the fields of UX/UI. I enrolled in the Google UX Design Professional Certificate, and learned the UX design process. As I learned about more specific design roles, I became particularly interested in visual design and using tools like Figma.</p>
        <h2>What I hope to achieve</h2>
        <p>I aspire to contribute to a world of well-made products. By thoroughly understanding visual design principles, I want to create mockups that really bring ideas to life.</p>
        <h2>Me, aside from design</h2>
        <p>In my free time, you'll often find me creating or learning something. Some of my non-design related hobbies include cooking/baking, finding something new to play on my guitar, teaching myself a technical skill, and drinking coffee.</p>
