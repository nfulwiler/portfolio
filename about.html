        <h2>Why I pursued design</h2>
        <p>When I found myself with more time throughout the pandemic, I wanted to learn new skills. I was initially interested in front-end engineering, and learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJS, etc. As I built mock webpages and websites to practice using these tools, I eventually realized that it was the creative aspect of web design that I found particularly rewarding, rather than the code writing itself. I began to research more into the design side of the process, and discovered the fields of UX/UI. I enrolled in the Google UX Design Professional Certificate, and learned the UX design process. As I learned about more specific design roles, I became particularly interested in visual design and using tools like Figma. The way this field combines artistic and analytical thinking makes it an especially exciting line of work to pursue, and I'm eager to keep learning!</p>
        <h2>What I hope to achieve</h2>
        <p>I aspire to contribute to a world of well-made products. By thoroughly understanding UX and visual design principles, I want to solve problems and create mockups that bring ideas to life.</p>
        <h2>Me, aside from design</h2>
        <p>In my free time, you'll often find me creating or learning something. Some of my non-design related hobbies include cooking/baking, finding something new to play on my guitar, teaching myself a technical skill, reading, and drinking coffee.</p>
