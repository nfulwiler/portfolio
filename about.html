        <h2>Why I pursued design</h2>
        <p>When I found myself with more time throughout the pandemic, I wanted to learn new skills. I was initially interested in front-end engineering, and learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJS, etc. As I built mock webpages and websites to practice using these tools, I eventually realized that it was the creative aspect of web design that I found particularly rewarding. I began to research more into the design side of the process, and discovered the fields of UX/UI. I enrolled in the Google UX Design Professional Certificate, learned the UX design process, visual design principles, and began building proficiency with tools like Figma. The way this field combines artistic and analytical thinking makes it an especially exciting line of work to pursue, and I'm eager to keep learning!</p>
        <h2>What I hope to achieve</h2>
        <p>I aspire to contribute to a world of well-made products. By thoroughly understanding UX, visual, and web design principles and guidelines, I want to create and implement designs that bring ideas to life.</p>
        <h2>Me, aside from design</h2>
        <p>In my free time, you'll often find me acquiring a new skill. Some of my non-design related hobbies include playing guitar, cooking/baking, reading, and drinking coffee.</p>
